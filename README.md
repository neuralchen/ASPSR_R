# Rebuttal for Paper ID 3044:

## Performance of Low rank
We report the performance results of low rank.
The large kernel size is $15\times 15$
It can be seen from Figure R1 that when k=1, the performance difference with full rank k=15 is in an acceptable range (0.06dB), which verifies the rationality of our ALK.

## Figure R1 (PSNR are evaluated in Urban100 $\times 4$):
